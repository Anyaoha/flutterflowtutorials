        "desc": "Hi and welcome to this tutorial on how to export a Firebase collection to a CSV file in Flutter.\n\nExporting data from a Firebase collection to a CSV file can be a useful way to backup or analyze your data. CSV, or Comma Separated Values, is a simple and widely supported file format that can be opened in a variety of applications, including spreadsheets and databases.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will show you how to use the Flutter framework to export a Firebase collection to a CSV file. This process involves retrieving the data from the Firebase collection, extracting the data that you want to include in the CSV file, creating a CSV string, and writing the string to a file.\n\nWe will start by installing the necessary dependencies and importing them in your Flutter code. Then, we will retrieve the data from the Firebase collection and extract the relevant data for each document.\n\nFinally, we will demonstrate how to display a message or perform some other action to let the user know that the export was successful.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will have learned how to export a Firebase collection to a CSV file in Flutter and will have the knowledge and tools to do so in your own projects.\n\n\nCode used in the video\nhttps://github.com/bulgariamitko/flutterflowtutorials/blob/main/Custom%20Actions/download-collection-as-csv.dart\n\nYou can book me as FF mentor - https://calendly.com/bulgaria_mitko",

        "desc": "In this video, I will explore the benefits of implementing null safety in your FlutterFlow applications. Null safety is a feature that helps you avoid common runtime errors in your code by ensuring that values are never null when they're not supposed to be. By adding null safety annotations to your code, you can catch potential errors early, and make it easier to maintain and update your code over time.\n\nI'll start by covering the basics of null safety and the different ways it can be implemented in FlutterFlow. From there, I'll dive into the process of adding null safety annotations to your existing code and working with nullable and non-nullable types. You'll learn how to handle null values correctly, and how to use the ?? operator and other null safety features to make your code more concise and readable.\n\nWhether you're a beginner or an experienced FlutterFlow developer, this video will help you improve your code quality and write more robust and maintainable applications. You'll learn how to take advantage of the benefits of null safety, and how to implement it effectively in your own projects. So, if you want to write high-quality code that is less prone to bugs and more maintainable over time, be sure to watch this video and start implementing null safety in your FlutterFlow projects today!\n\nCode used\nhttps://github.com/bulgariamitko/flutterflowtutorials/blob/main/Custom%20Actions/null-safety.dart\n\nYou can book me as FF mentor or support my work\nhttps://calendly.com/bulgaria_mitko",

        "desc": "Hi and welcome to this tutorial on how to implement a HTML rich text editor in Flutter and connect it to Firebase.\n\nA rich text editor is a tool that allows users to create and edit formatted text, including bold, italic, and underlined text, as I'll as insert images, links, and other media. Implementing a rich text editor in Flutter can be a useful way to allow users to create and edit formatted content in your app.\n\nIn this tutorial, I will show you how to use the Flutter framework to implement a HTML rich text editor and connect it to Firebase. This process involves creating a text editor using a package like html_editor_enhanced, setting up a Firebase project and database, and using the cloud_firestore package to read and write data to the database.\n\nI will start by installing the necessary dependencies and creating a text editor using the html_editor_enhanced package. Then, I will set up a Firebase project and database and import the cloud_firestore package in our Flutter code.\n\nNext, I will demonstrate how to use the cloud_firestore package to read and write data to the database, including retrieving data for display in the text editor and saving user-generated content to the database.\n\nFinally, I will show you how to use the html_editor_enhanced package to format and style the text in the editor and how to insert images, links, and other media.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will have learned how to implement a HTML rich text editor in Flutter and connect it to Firebase, and will have the knowledge and tools to do so in your own projects.
